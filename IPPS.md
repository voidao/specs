# IPPS - InterPlanetary Personal Space

> IPPS is based on [IPFS](https://github.com/ipfs/specs/)([ipld](https://github.com/ipld/specs)|[multiformats](https://github.com/multiformats/multiformats)|[libp2p](https://github.com/libp2p/specs)), which by nature is an egalitarian way to build and share a distributed web at large, without any centralization or authority whatsoever. However, there is gap between personality and egalitarianism. This is where IPPS comes into existence, facilitating a distributed web of people universe.
