# IPPS - InterPlanetary Personal Space

> IPPS is based on [IPFS](https://github.com/ipfs/specs/)([ipld](https://github.com/ipld/specs)|[multiformats](https://github.com/multiformats/multiformats)|[libp2p](https://github.com/libp2p/specs)), which by nature is an egalitarian way to build and share a distributed web at large, without any centralization or authority whatsoever. However, there is gap between personalism and egalitarianism. This is where IPPS comes into existence, to deeply associate person with personal explorations in the distributed web, facilitating a distributed web of people universe.

- personal explorations must be fully controlled by the person
- personal explorations need to be consolidated for the person

🐳`personal IPNS namespace to personal explorations as personal IPLD space`
- *IPLD trees for recording explorations*
- *IPNS records for linking IPLD trees*
- *IPLD-IPNS cross customizations for strengthening control and consolidation*

> 🐳`Custom IPLD Format/Resolver`   // interactive with person against personal IPNS namespace?

> 🐳`Custom IPNS Record/Resolver`   // interactive with person against personal IPLD space?
